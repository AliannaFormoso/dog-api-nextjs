## ‚úç Instructions

1. Consume [API Dogs](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) by using a NextJs project.
2. Render ten dog breeds with their corresponding images.

### Getting Started

There are two ways you can work locally. Or, you can take advantage of the live server.

To get the repository you can either:

- Download the project from GitHub by clicking on the green button and selecting download.
- Forking the repository and then clone it to your local machine (see info on forking in the GitHub documentation: [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

#### [Optional] Forking and Cloning

To fork the repository, click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page. Once forked, view the repository under your repositories. Clone the your repository to your local machine by running:

```bash
git clone path/to/your/GitHub/repository
```

#### Accessing the Working Directory

Then, you will need to change your working directory to the project's directory folder in this repo - all the scripts, should run within the directory. In the terminal window, type `cd nextjs-api-dogs` and hit [**enter**].
Make sure you're in this folder. Once in the working directory, you'll see the package.json file at the same level.

#### Install Dependencies

Once in the working directory, you need to add all of the dependencies for the live server to work.

```bash
npm install
```

You will see a new folder has been created named `node_modules`. Because of its size, I don't push it or pull it from repositories. It's better just rebuild it by running the command above.

### Running the Live Server

You can use either of the following commands, it depends on your preferences.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Once you have entered this code, the live server will continue to run. If you would like to stop the server, type **[control] [c]**. You will see the terminal window exit the live server.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
